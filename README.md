Scripts, tests and other stuff about mikrotik

Hy folks,

I've made a dynamic failover script that uses 'N' ping hosts to determine if 'N' internet links are up or down.

The script creates the routes dynamically to ping hosts, make the tests and then, delete de routes.

I never found anything similar, so i chose to share with you. Feel free to criticize, comment or suggest improvements.

And sorry for my english :)
